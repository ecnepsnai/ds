Depending on the severity of the issue, which may be larger than you think, we ask that we keep reports private until

# Q & A

**Do you offer any form of reward for identifying security issues?**
We do not run a bug bounty program and do not offer monetary rewards. this package is an open source project with
absolutely no budget. All expenses for the project are donated. We will provide credit to you (of a name of your choice
and single link to a social media profile) in release notes for discovered issues.
