# Security Policy

The developers of DS aim to make security a priority for the project. This document describes our policy for handling
security vulnerabilities within the DS software.

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent release of DS is supported. Older versions are not supported and may contain unfixed security
vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities as issues on Github as these are visible to the public.**

Depending on the severity of the issue, which may be larger than you think, we ask that we keep reports private until
we can determine the scope of the issue.

Please contact the lead developer, Ian Spence, using the Signal number available on [his website](https://ianspence.com)

# Q & A

**Do you offer any form of reward for identifying security issues?**
We do not run a bug bounty program and do not offer monetary rewards. DS is an open source project with absolutely no
budget. All expenses for the project are donated. We will provide credit to you (of a name of your choice and single
link to a social media profile) in release notes for discovered issues.
